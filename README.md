# CleaningDataProject
This is my project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course.  In this folder you'll find:
* Readme
* run_analysis.R
* tidyData.txt


The file "tidyData.txt" can be loaded using the command `read.table("tidyData.txt", header = TRUE)`


# Criteria for grading
* The submitted data set is tidy.
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available 
codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and 
summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant 
information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
* The work submitted for this project is the work of the 
student who submitted it.
